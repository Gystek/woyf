woyf - watch over your files
----------------------------
woyf is a stupidly simple file watcher using inotify(7).

Requirements
------------
In order to build woyf you need a C compiler and a "make" program.

Installation

Edit config.mk to match your local setup (woyf is installed into the
/usr/local/ namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install woyf (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install

See the man page for details.
